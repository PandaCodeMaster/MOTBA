-----------------------------------------------------
Battle:

A Battle is a single unit of play in MOTBA. Could be thought of as a "Match".
The goal of a Battle is to draft the best team you can, and be the last team standing.

A battle is broken down into a number of Stages. They are as follows:
1: Reserve Selection
2: Arena Selection
3: Team Creation
4: The Reveal
5: Placement
6: Fight
7: Results

Each of these Stages will be described below.

------------------------------------------------
Reserve Selection

In Reserve Selection, each player will select their collection of Characters
and Artifacts from which they will build their team to bring into battle.
There are 2 main forms of Reserve Selection: Prepared, and Draft. Each these forms
have a few variants. These variants can apply to Character Selection, Artifact Selection,
or both.

Standard Prepared:
1: A reserve of 5 cards are selected from the Pool by each player in separate.
Each player has access to the entire Pool for the respective card type.
2: Once all players have picked their Reserves, all Reserves are revealed.


Unique Prepared: 
1: A reserve of 5 cards are selected from a shared pool of the respective card type.
Cards are selected in no particular order. A player can only reserve cards they put into
their Reserve. If it isn't in the Reserve, it is available for selection.
Cards are available in a first come - first serve basis.
2: Once all players have picked their Reserves, all Reserves are revealed.

Standard Draft:
1: Each Player selects a random card from the Number deck. (Except for players who picked initial roles in previous stages this Battle)
2: The Player with the highest card chooses "First Pick" or "Double Ban". 
	The Player to their right gets the one that wasn't selected.
	Stage Play Direction (SPD) is clockwise if the Player picked "First Pick", counter-clockwise if "Double Ban"
3: Draft starts with "First Pick" and proceeds in SPD with each player picking one card to "Ban". 
	Banned cards are removed from the Pool for the rest of this Battle.
4: When it gets to the last "Double Ban Player" that player gets to ban a second and final card.
5: "First Pick" Player becomes "Draft Leader"
6: Play starts with the Draft Lead and continues in SPD, with each player taking a card from the pool,
	and adding it to their reserve.
7: After all players have picked, the "Draft Leader" position goes to the next Player in clockwise order.
8: Repeat 6, and 7 until all players have picked 5 cards.

Team Creation

Team Creation is the Stage in which players form the team which they will bring to battle.
The goal is to bring the team and loadout you feel will bring you victory based on your options,
your opponent's options, and the Battle Arena.

While Reserves are Public Information, at this Stage, Teams are Hidden Information.

Teams are made from 3 Character slots, and 3 Artifact slots.
Place Characters in a row, face down, left to right, in the order you wish them to be revealed.
Then place Artifacts in a second row, facedown, left to right, in the order you wish them to be revealed.

Some Characters and Artifacts take up multiple slots. In the case you select these cards for your Team.
you may put blank cards down to fill in "gaps". No real card can be right of a blank card, real cards
must all be placed in earlier slots, before the blank cards.
