-----------------------------------------------
This Repository was setup to track the rules, characters, artifacts, maps, and other
game elements of MOTBA over its development, as a means of providing a design history
of the game.

MOTBA is being created to fill a hole in tabletop gaming, that of a high quality
miniatures game, that can be played with as cheap, or as expensive of components as
the player has access to and/or wishes to use.

It is also a game that tries to distill the essence of "making builds" and theorycrafting
into a reasonably sized game, without other associated trappings of RPGs and MMOs.

Design Pillars
-----------------------------------------------
1: Sane to Print and Play
2: Breaking the game is part of the fun.
3: Simple and Short enough to encourage immediate rematches.
